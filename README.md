## Project Insight
- Peak Sales Months – March and August lead, while May and June present growth opportunities.
- Top-Performing Categories – "Colors" and "Soft Toys" dominate revenue, while Mugs and Plants have potential for optimization.
- Occasion-Based Sales – Anniversaries, Holi, and Raksha Bandhan drive significant revenue, but Diwali sales could be improved.
- Customer Buying Behavior – Most orders occur early morning and evening, indicating strategic ad placement opportunities.
- Top Cities by Orders – Dhanbad, Imphal, and Kavali emerge as strong markets.

## Final Conclusion
This dashboard highlights key opportunities to boost sales by optimizing peak months like March and August while targeting slow 
periods with strategic promotions. Focusing on top-performing categories like Colors and Soft Toys, bundling lower-selling items, 
and enhancing occasion-based marketing for Holi and Raksha Bandhan can drive higher revenue. Understanding peak buying times enables 
better ad placements, while expanding in high-order cities like Dhanbad and Imphal can further accelerate growth. With data-driven 
strategies, businesses can maximize profitability and customer engagement effectively.
